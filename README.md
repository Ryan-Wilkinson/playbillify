# Playbillify
Final Project for WDI-9

## Background

Arts organizations depend on grants, donors and ticket sales to generate revenue for their mission. Many people don't realize that ad sales from printed programs for performances are also an integral way for them to raise funds. With the threat of budget cuts to arts grants, additional revenue channels such as program ads will become increasingly more important. However, with the amount of time and energy it requires to solicit businesses door-to-door to sell ads, many arts organizations simply don't have the time to sell and manage ads. 

## Project Overview

Playbillify is a simple to use application that connects arts organizations with local businesses online to buy and sell program ads. Arts organizations can list events and available ad spaces for purchase for their event playbills and raise funds through these sales. Local businessess can purchase ad slots to advertise to potential customers out and about in their communities and directly upload the ad images to the app. It's a win-win for both the arts and local businesses.
